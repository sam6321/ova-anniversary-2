OVA 2nd Anniversary: Judgement Day

First of all, here's to another year. 
I... don't really know what else to say. I mean, we've had our ups and downs. DnD has become a thing. SL is slowly creeping back into our minds.
The server will be more alive since Christmas Break will soon become a thing. I guess I should thank you all for putting up with my bullshit most of all, since
Lord help me I'm almost always back on my bullshit. Notable events since the last anniversary:
- DnD started
- Tyler left (and came back)
- Dou left (and came back)
- Zack left (and came back)
Anyway, after this thrilling list of events we should get to the honorable mentions list of people:
- Supper Rad
- Mutebrogen
- Any Gay Five ten
- Vose
- Cray Sontelov
- Shuegay
- Say 'Sayo-nara' to Gibraltar you Spanish fucks
- Yashee
- Deelean
- Zacquery aka Momando
- Zach
- InfectedBoldAndBrash
- Do Weed
and last but not least
whoever the fuck is reading this who I haven't mentioned

you're all cool but you're all also pretty fucking gay
Anyway let's try to not let drama consume us for another year.
Calzone out.
