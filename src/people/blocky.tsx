            <h2>Blocky</h2>
            <p>
                Heya, this is Yuri Red or Blocky or whatever you call me.
            </p>
            <p>
                I just like to say thank you to everyone for the past 2 years. Usually, when I join a community group. Usually, I either get disinterested where I would leave or drama happens where I just leave and move on. But with you guys at the OVA, it wasn’t like that at all. Despite everything that happened to us and how much inactive I was in certain events I wasn’t there for. I am still here talking to y’all and having fun no matter what. To think we started off from DDLC’s reddit discord group and become one of the most greatest personal group I’ve ever been in.
            </p>
            <p>
                I know I haven’t been there for some stuff and that maybe I should least talk more about myself or get more involved. Or maybe I should actually try writing down puns for once. But nonetheless, you guys were always there for me and hopefully I can be there for you too.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here are some people I like to talk about a bit for the past two years.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Sayo</b>: You’re a person whom I sometimes hate and love at the same time (no homo). But despite that, you’re a great friend worth hanging out with and I hope we can hang around more in the future. I wish you luck in whatever life problem that will get in the way. Also, I still appreciated for helping me in one of my essays for my past college.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Snow/Shu</b>: You’re a very talented artist and you continue to amaze me on how much you improved on ya art. Continue to be kind to others my friend and never lose the passion for the things you love. I would also like to thank you for making me become interested in Danganronpa last year and it was an experience I’ll never forget. Follow your dreams and I am sure you will have a great job as an artist. Keep up the good work!
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Supa</b>: You’re one of the most sweetest people I’ve met on the OVA and had some things in common too. We even used to live in the same state until I moved away unfortunately. However, continue to spread your kindness to others and never forget the great times you have with us at the OVA.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Vase</b>: At first, I thought you were one of those very insensitive guys who tried to be cool. But the more I see about you over the years and the time we spent together on discord or twitter. I realized that you are more than that and I think you’re a pretty great guy worth talking to. I’m grateful for all the fun times we had together my man. I hope we continue to talk more to each other again on discord or outside of discord.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Kray</b>: I know you see me as some supid annoying person who makes unfunny jokes and wish that I should be in the gulag. But even so, I think you’re cool guy who sometimes make me laugh when it comes to communism jokes. Overall, you’re someone that people could look up too and I can respect that. Hopefully, we can talk more to each other so that you won’t see me as someone annoying or not funny.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Any</b>: You’re a swell guy any. I like the passion you have on certain topics you love to talk about and you’re one of the funniest guys I’ve met on OVA too. I can also relate to you lot since we both have disabilities that affects our way of living sometimes but despite so, I believe as long we keep doing our best. We would have a future worth looking towards. Keep being yourself and I’ll continue to support you from the sidelines.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Cell</b>: You may or may not be in the OVA anymore. But I just want you to know that you were a great mod and I remember how funny you were during our time here together. So wherever you are, don’t let life take a dump on you and continue to move on forward with all the good memories we spend together.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Cake</b>: I remember that you were a weirdo but you were our weirdo. You know what I mean? I thought you and vase made a great duo last year and that you can be a great and funny person as well. I know life can be harsh and that there were things you regret wishing that would had never happened. But nonetheless, me and all the others at OVA will always like you and hope that wherever you were. Keep being the best person you can be.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Dou</b>: I don’t know if we had talked a lot to each other lately. But I really think you’re an awesome friend that loves to have fun with Sayo and the rest of us. I know that back on those past months or last year, you have an awful experience about yourself and others around you. And all of that was behind the scenes. It must have been pretty tough on you and I wished some of that could have been prevented. Nonetheless, I think things are starting to work out for you in the end and you can finally move on to something better. I can respect that and hope we can talk more to each other in the future too.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Zack</b>: We may not talked much to each other. But like most people from the OVA, I remember you being such a kind guy who loves to talk about the games we like together including smash brothers too. Someday, when I ever have a Nintendo Switch and Smash Ultimate in the future. I hope that I can play online with ya where we can have some fun on the things we love. Also, no matter how rough life can be. We will cheer from the OVA for ya, don’t forget that.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Tyler</b>: I know we haven’t talked to each other a lot and I kinda wished that I should have known you more. But even though you made some pretty bad mistakes over these past few months. I can only hope you can try your best to become a better person than the person you used to be. It’s not too late to forgive yourself yet. Just know that sometimes, you don’t need a boyfriend to love you. I think you just need someone who can be your best friend and appreciate who you are. Don’t force yourself and try to take all the steps at once. Just take things slowly and I believe you will have a life that you can look back on. Also I’ll always remember the fun times we have together with you even if some of it were dumb shit. I just hope you learn from your mistakes and never let anyone go on the path you’re going through.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Mute</b>: You’re also a good friend that people would love to talk with too. I don’t know if I remembered that much from our interactions together.I blame my short-term memory for that. However, I do remember the fun times we played SL together and how we once comforted you on the vent stuff too I think. So whatever you are doing right now, I hope you’re doing well.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Zach</b>: Again, I don’t know if we had talked that much either. But I remember you took an interested in programming and that’s great! You should continue to be interested in that so that you could become a great video game programmer in the future! I hope you continue your passion on the things you love.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Dash</b>: I remember you were very weird and that you were interested in some weird stuff. But it doesn’t mean you aren’t a great friend and an admin. In fact, you were one of the best I’ve seen because you kept the server stable and I don’t think I’ve ever seen you having trouble with us that much at the OVA. So keep doing the best of work my friend.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Cal</b>: Once again, not sure if we have talked that much. But I know that you’re also a cool dude too. So wherever you are doing, I hope you are doing well and having a good time of your life my dude.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Deelon</b>: Despite everything, you remain as one of the most nicest people I’ve ever met on the OVA and sometimes I wish I could have been nice as you too. So like always, always continue to spread kindness even to complete strangers. Because who knows? People will always lend a hand to you back whenever you are in trouble or need some help. Always be yourself.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Nee</b>: We might not talk much and you may think I’m just some dude who makes unfunny shit. But I know we have some good times together when we all played SL and that counts as much of having a good time. So maybe in the future, I hope we can get to know each other as pals.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Singy</b>: As fellow asians. You’re an awesome my man. Even though you’re younger than me, you can make such good sprite animations or even animations in general. That’s great! Not only that, out of everyone else in the OVA. I think you’re the only one that doesn’t mind the stupid unfunny jokes I said over these past months lmao. Life will get tough but as long you have people like us as friends in your life, push forward with all you got and reach for any goal you want to reach. I honestly hope you have a good future with an awesome job stingy. Keep going towards life.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Aegwynn</b>: I’ll thought I save this for last. But regardless if you aren’t in OVA anymore or maybe you are right now. I cannot thank you enough for introducing me into the OVA and meeting all these wonderful people. If I haven’t met you back in the SilvaGunner fan server back in 2016, I don’t think I would ever have a chance to be apart of the OVA and learn so much from them too. Heck, if I never joined the DDLC Reddit server or joined in too late. I would never even meet anyone from the OVA at all. I know you think that you’re not important to other people due to how shitty your life is or how many people you might have pissed off on the internet. It doesn’t matter because I couldn’t thank you enough for creating the OVA server for us and leading for all of us to know each other and have fun for better or worse. I also think that you’re honestly still a valid and good person as well despite everything. Just don’t let people on your life use you as a doormat or bully you like trash. If you ever tell yourself that you never did anything impactful in your life, I will tell you otherwise. You're much stronger and better than you think you are. Thanks for everything, I wish you good luck my friend.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>As for everyone else I didn’t mention</b>: I don’t know if I had talked with anyone else in the OVA too but I wish you a happy new year for the next decade and beyond too!
            </p>
            <p>
                Once again, thank you everyone in the OVA for these past two years and hopefully I’ll get more involved next time if my life doesn’t shit on me either. I hope we can still all talk to each other for even two more years to come or even if OVA ever were to die. Until then, make yourself and everyone around you smile. I wish you all the best of times my friends!
            </p>
