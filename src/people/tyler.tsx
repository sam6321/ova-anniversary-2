                I guess this is kinda a 2 for 1 combo of addressing my return and the anniversary cause I’m tying them together because it would be hard not to mention my absence in my message so ok awesome enjoy the wild ride.

                So if you asked me about ovas second anniversary last week, I’d have said that I wasn’t looking forward to it. I mean sure I’d be glad that ova lasted two whole years but I knew it’s suck not being part of it.
            </p>
            <p>
                But shockingly I’m actually here even tho I was told so many times it’d never happen and honestly I didn’t have much hope for it either but I knew I had to try cause ova meant too much to me for me not to. I know dash spoke to people about whether or not I should be allowed back, and I really just wanna take this moment to say thank you to anyone who said it’d be okay for me to rejoin, it means a lot and I’m super grateful, that includes dou, thanks for being chill about it, I really do appreciate it. I hold no grudges.

                Not being in ova for 6 months made me realise how much it meant to me and how much I kinda took it, and the people in it for granted while I was here before. Like I met so many cool people here, some of my best friends are the ones I’ve met here,  I’ve had some of the best times here, and this server really did help me get through a lot of things over the last two years. Whenever I was having a hard time I’d go and hang out and talk with you guys here in ova and it was one of the only things that actually worked for me to take my mind off the bad shit. Y’all were (and have been) great friends to me over the last 2 years and I feel like meeting you guys really helped me change as a person, in many good ways which is pretty evident irl compared to a few years ago. Which I suppose is part of the reason why it was so rough being gone, past 6 months, although necessary because punishment is needed, and I needed to figure some shit out, the past 6 months is not something I ever want to go through again.

                Basically what I’m trying to say that this place means a lot to me as do all of you and hopefully that’s more obvious in the future than it used to be. I know I haven’t always been good to people here but you guys have always meant a lot to me even tho I’ve been incredibly trash at showing it lmao. I hope I can be a good friend to y’all again from now on.
            </p>

                I really have made some fucking great friends in ova. I want to say thank you the people in the gbs server who were cool about me talking there, I liked getting to talk to you guys again after everything.
            </p>
            <p>
                The biggest thank you tho is the one I need to say to the few people who continued to be my friend and spoke to me and was there for me over the last 6 months while I wasn’t in ova. You guys were my friend when everything was kinda  fucking shit and I really appreciate you and am so grateful to you, you have no idea how glad I’ve been to have you guys as my friends, you kept me somewhat sane lmao so thank you. And I got to know you better and like I got to know you guys much better than I did when I was actually in ova so that was super great, you know who you are.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thank you to Dash and Zack for being owner and co-owner over the last 6 months, clearly one of my better decisions was handing ova over to you guys specifically and I know you’ll keep doing a good shit, you guys were definitely the ones for the job.
            </p>
            <p>
                It really is fucking great to be back. I’m glad this place has lasted two years, after all the shit it’s still going and that’s pretty damn cool. See you cunts for another long essay next year, maybe I’ll be reading it in vc cause I’m sure as fuck not going another year without talking in vc lmao this typing shit is old news.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyway thanks for sticking together for two years. People come and go and return but this place sticks around and I couldn’t be more glad. Y’all cool ok bye.
