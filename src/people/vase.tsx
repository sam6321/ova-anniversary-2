            <p>
                Dear <mark>Whores</mark>,
            </p>
            <p>
                I <mark>don’t</mark> remember how I wrote this last year, but it was probably <mark>lame. Since</mark> last year<mark>’s anniversary</mark> a lot of things have happened, <mark>like Tyler fucking up in the biggest way imaginable, then returning as if</mark> nothing ever happened somehow. That’s pretty much everything notable that’s happened, actually.
            </p>
            <p>
                After a short summary of the year, comes the part where I discuss my feelings, so let’s get to the point. You’re all people that I have talked to at least once, I think. As such, I can safely say that I think <mark>most of</mark> you are cool <mark>(the ones that I don’t consider cool I will not name, because I’m not a meanie, but some of you can really suck it like DAMN), except Tyler and some others.</mark> I’ve enjoyed talking to you, even though I did that considerably less this year.
            </p>
            <p>
                If I don’t drop some names then this text will really be too short so here are some notable names: Sayororonoa, Super red, Mutegen, Joe, Steven Davids (remember this name), that guy I forgot his name I think it was something like stinky fingers, anykey_12, Joshi, Zac, <mark>Zaq</mark> and other such spellings, my boy who got a gf (Calmaskys), D<mark>DD</mark>DDD<mark>D</mark>DDDD<mark>DDD</mark>D, <mark>Delon</mark> and last but not least, Shoe
            </p>
            <p>
                I hope you’ve noticed that I’ve been getting progressively less funny as time goes on, because I’ve gone from like -1<mark>5</mark> laughs per sentence, to at least -<mark>95</mark>2<mark>x</mark>, <mark>x being the biggest number one can imagine</mark>. So before I become even less funny, I just want to say, from the depth of my heart, <mark>SHUT THE FUCK UP</mark>
            </p>
            <p>
                I would also like to thank Zach or Zack<mark> or Zaq or whatever</mark> for DM’ing our DnD sessions because that’s a lot of fun most of the time, even though he’s on break now, the memory remains.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let’s talk about another thing that remains<mark>, my hatred for</mark> you. <mark>My hatred for you</mark> all never leave<mark>s, it</mark> only grow<mark>s</mark>. Like, GOD, please<mark> shut the FUCK up already you fucking losers</mark>. Like a JoJo fan running to<mark> suck an unsucked cock, I want to escape from this bullshit called</mark> OVA.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, there is one person I haven’t thanked.<mark> The one person that keeps me in OVA, even though I hate literally everyone in it.</mark> That is, the waifu bot. I would like to thank the waifu bot for keeping me sending messages in OVA, <mark>even if they don’t really bring anything to the conversation because I’m just rolling png’s. At least</mark> I have Kira and Usopp.
            </p>
            <p>
                I want to thank one more person, that person is someone I hold dear. I truly care about them and consider them a good friend, <mark>among all the unlikeable whore fuckfricks in OVA,</mark> and that is <mark>Vase. Did you know that the V in</mark> OVA<mark> stands for Vase? I don’t think it does but now it does. Vase is</mark> such a beautiful <mark>man/vase</mark> it makes me cry, I think about how brilliant and funny he is whenever I go to sleep. I cry about how I will never be as good as him, because he is the Roman goddess Minerva(se).
            </p>
            <p>
                Within this entire, massive epic, you probably didn’t expect there to be a single serious sentence. Well you’ll be surprised. Eventually.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, it is time for a moment of silence for the fallen. I hope you all remembered the name Steven Davids. Steven Davids, he was a <mark>good</mark> man, he was indeed what you would call, a <mark>fucking dumbass</mark> child. But we loved Steven, and we are sad to see him become just a shell of his former self, and we are even sadder to see him never come back (pensive emoji).<br/>
                UPDATE: He came back earlier today but <mark>after seeing Tyler he did the logical thing and</mark> left again.
            </p>
            <p>
                Speaking of Tyler, <mark>it’s really weird how</mark> she <mark>basically did some terrible</mark> really<mark> goddamn bad shit and came back like it never</mark> happened. <mark>She just took a short break and now she’s back in OVA to be an e-girl and a whore like she used to,</mark> good for her! But what’s <mark>not</mark> good is that you people said yes to her coming back (not unexpected though).
            </p>
            <p>
                We might be nearing the finish line, <mark>but don’t</mark> cry on me, for everything good must come to an end, and so must this beautiful, tear-jerking story. I would actually like to sincerely and truthfully thank <mark>most of</mark> you for everything you’ve done for me. You’ve helped me through when I felt bad, I’m never serious about anything so you probably didn’t even know, but you really have. So thank you.
            </p>
            <p>
                As the paragraphs go by, I realise I should probably end this soon, but I have extended it so far I can’t find a logical place to end it. So I just want to thank the entire collective known as OVA for teaching me to love myself, because I could’ve turned out far worse.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sincerely, Vase~
