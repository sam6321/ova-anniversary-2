Ey fellas

Im bad at putting my thoughts down and stuff, but here I go anyways. Basically y'all are fuckin great. I'll be fully honest when I say you all are some of the best damn friends I've ever had. I'm a sappy bitch but there's literally nothing I look forward to quite as much as hanging out with you guys, whenever we just talk on discord or play games or otherwise. Y'all are genuinely the fucking nicest, funniest, and coolest people I've ever met. Playin games with you guys is a total blast and every dumb moment we have in SL and L4D2 sticks in my mind as some of the most fun I've ever had. I'm not gonna meme it up as much right now, just gonna say fully from the heart, you guys are awesome, and I'm really glad to call you all my friends, its been a fucking great 2 years and I'm looking forwards to all the bullshit we do in the future. Love y'all no homo.
