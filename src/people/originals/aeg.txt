here's a good way to sum up how i feel about this anniversary. i still have that old text file from last year saved. i read it sometimes, mulling over how i could have wrote it better or given it more thought. i end up wondering how everyone is doing, and what they think of me now. and then i finish that train of thought with all the guilt that i never made things better, i never got a chance to be a better me around you all.
it feels like i wrote that message yesterday. i could remember all the tears and the twinges in my chest as i laid in bed like i am now thinking about a server of people i wanted to make good, yet i never bothered to improve.
come this time next year, i want to have a year's worth of memories between now and then. i'm gonna stay for good this time, and make sure i dont miss another moment with yall.
i really love you guys. i hope it's not too much trouble if i stick around. hopefully next time i write one of these i'll be able to thank you all for a great year.
