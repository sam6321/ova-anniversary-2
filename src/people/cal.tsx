                First of all, here's to another year.<br/>
                I... don't really know what else to say. I mean, we've had our ups and downs. DnD has become a thing. SL is slowly creeping back into our minds.<br/>
                The server will be more alive since Christmas Break will soon become a thing. I guess I should thank you all for putting up with my bullshit most of all, since<br/>
                Lord help me I'm almost always back on my bullshit. Notable events since the last anniversary:<br/>
                - DnD started<br/>
